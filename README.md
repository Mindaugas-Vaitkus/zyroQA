QA Engineer (Mid/Senior) task

Identify 3 most critical user flows, write your insights and send the description.
Automate one of those flows - create E2E test (use any automation tool you like).
Commit the source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link.
It would be nice to have a live demo.
